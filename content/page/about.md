My name is Keith Goldfeld and I am on the faculty in the Division of Biostatistics, which is part of the Department of Population Health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, located in New York City. For more info (like publications and a big photo), go [here](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/keith-s-goldfeld){target="_blank"}. Here is a copy of my [CV](/pdf/cv.pdf).
