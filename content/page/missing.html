<h2>Missing data</h2>
<p>After generating a complete data set, it is possible to generate missing data. <code>defMiss</code> defines the parameters of missingness. <code>genMiss</code> generates a missing data matrix of indicators for each field. Indicators are set to 1 if the data are missing for a subject, 0 otherwise. <code>genObs</code> creates a data set that reflects what would have been observed had data been missing; this is a replicate of the orginal data set with “NAs” replacing values where missing data has been generated.</p>
<p>By controlling the parameters of missingness, it is possible to represent different missing data mechanisms: (1) <em>missing completely at random</em> (MCAR), where the probability missing data is independent of any covariates, measured or unmeasured, that are associated with the measure, (2) <em>missing at random</em> (MAR), where the probability of subject missing data is a function only of observed covariates that are associated with the measure, and (3) <em>not missing at random</em> (NMAR), where the probability of missing data is related to unmeasured covariates that are associated with measure.</p>
<p>These possibilities are illustrated with an example. A data set of 1000 observations with three “outcome” measures&quot; <code>x1</code>, <code>x2</code>, and <code>x3</code> is defined. This data set also includes two independent predictors, <code>m</code> and <code>u</code> that largely determine the value of each outcome (subject to random noise).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>def1 &lt;- defData(varname = &quot;m&quot;, dist = &quot;binary&quot;, formula = 0.5)
def1 &lt;- defData(def1, &quot;u&quot;, dist = &quot;binary&quot;, formula = 0.5)
def1 &lt;- defData(def1, &quot;x1&quot;, dist = &quot;normal&quot;, formula = &quot;20*m + 20*u&quot;, variance = 2)
def1 &lt;- defData(def1, &quot;x2&quot;, dist = &quot;normal&quot;, formula = &quot;20*m + 20*u&quot;, variance = 2)
def1 &lt;- defData(def1, &quot;x3&quot;, dist = &quot;normal&quot;, formula = &quot;20*m + 20*u&quot;, variance = 2)

dtAct &lt;- genData(1000, def1)</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the missing data mechanism is different for each outcome. As defined below, missingness for <code>x1</code> is MCAR, since the probability of missing is fixed. Missingness for <code>x2</code> is MAR, since missingness is a function of <code>m</code>, a measured predictor of <code>x2</code>. And missingness for <code>x3</code> is NMAR, since the probability of missing is dependent on <code>u</code>, an unmeasured predictor of <code>x3</code>:</p>

<p>The impacts of the various data mechanisms on estimation can be seen with a simple calculation of means using both the “true” data set without missing data as a comparison for the “observed” data set. Since <code>x1</code> is MCAR, the averages for both data sets are roughly equivalent. However, we can see below that estimates for <code>x2</code> and <code>x3</code> are biased, as the difference between observed and actual is not close to 0:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Two functions to calculate means and compare them

rmean &lt;- function(var, digits = 1) {
    round(mean(var, na.rm = TRUE), digits)
}

showDif &lt;- function(dt1, dt2, rowName = c(&quot;Actual&quot;, &quot;Observed&quot;, &quot;Difference&quot;)) {

<p>After adjusting for the measured covariate <code>m</code>, the bias for the estimate of the mean of <code>x2</code> is mitigated, but not for <code>x3</code>, since <code>u</code> is not observed:</p>

<h2>Longitudinal data with missingness</h2>
<p>Missingness can occur, of course, in the context of longitudinal data. <code>missDef</code> provides two additional arguments that are relevant for these types of datas: <code>baseline</code> and <code>monotonic</code>. In the case of variables that are measured at baseline only, a missing value would be reflected throughout the course of the study. In the case where a variable is time-dependent (i.e it is measured at each time point), it is possible to declare missingness to be <em>monotonic</em>. This means that if a value for this field is missing at time <code>t</code>, then values will also be missing at all times <code>T &gt; t</code> as well. The call to <code>genMiss</code> must set <code>repeated</code> to TRUE.</p>
<p>The following two examples describe an outcome variable <code>y</code> that is measured over time, whose value is a function of time and an observed exposure:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># use baseline definitions from previous example

dtAct &lt;- genData(120, def1)
dtAct &lt;- trtObserve(dtAct, formulas = 0.5, logit.link = FALSE, grpName = &quot;rx&quot;)

# add longitudinal data

defLong &lt;- defDataAdd(varname = &quot;y&quot;, dist = &quot;normal&quot;, formula = &quot;10 + period*2 + 2 * rx&quot;, 
    variance = 2)

dtTime &lt;- addPeriods(dtAct, nPeriods = 4)
dtTime &lt;- addColumns(defLong, dtTime)</code></pre>
<p>In the first case, missingness is not monotonic; a subject might miss a measurement but returns for subsequent measurements:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># missingness for y is not monotonic

defMlong &lt;- defMiss(varname = &quot;x1&quot;, formula = 0.2, baseline = TRUE)
defMlong &lt;- defMiss(defMlong, varname = &quot;y&quot;, formula = &quot;-1.5 - 1.5 * rx + .25*period&quot;, 
    logit.link = TRUE, baseline = FALSE, monotonic = FALSE)

missMatLong &lt;- genMiss(dtTime, defMlong, idvars = c(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;rx&quot;), repeated = TRUE, 
    periodvar = &quot;period&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Here is a conceptual plot that shows the pattern of missingness. Each row represents an individual, and each box represents a time period. A box that is colored reflects missing data; a box colored grey reflects observed. The missingness pattern is shown for two variables <code>x1</code> and <code>y</code>:</p>
<p><img src="/page/missing_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In the second case, missingness is monotonic; once a subject misses a measurement for <code>y</code>, there are no subsequent measurements:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># missingness for y is not monotonic

defMlong &lt;- defMiss(varname = &quot;x1&quot;, formula = 0.2, baseline = TRUE)
defMlong &lt;- defMiss(defMlong, varname = &quot;y&quot;, formula = &quot;-1.8 - 1.5 * rx + .25*period&quot;, 
    logit.link = TRUE, baseline = FALSE, monotonic = TRUE)

missMatLong &lt;- genMiss(dtTime, defMlong, idvars = c(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;rx&quot;), repeated = TRUE, 
    periodvar = &quot;period&quot;)</code></pre>
