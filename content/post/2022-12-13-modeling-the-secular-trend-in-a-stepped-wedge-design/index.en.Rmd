[Recently](https://www.rdatagen.net/post/2022-11-01-modeling-secular-trend-in-crt-using-gam/){target="_blank"} I started a discussion about modeling secular trends using flexible models in the context of a cluster randomized trial. My explorations on this topic are motivated by a cluster randomized trial using a stepped-wedge study design that I am involved with. The first post focused on more standard parallel designs; here, I want to extend the discussion explicitly to stepped-wedge designs.

### The stepped-wedge design

Stepped-wedge designs are a special class of cluster randomized trial where each cluster is observed in both treatment arms (as opposed to the classic parallel design where only some of the clusters receive the treatment). This is a special case of a cross-over design, where the cross-over is only in one direction: control (or pre-intervention) to intervention. I've written about this in a number of different contexts (for example, with respect to [power analysis](https://www.rdatagen.net/post/alternatives-to-stepped-wedge-designs/), [complicated ICC patterns](https://www.rdatagen.net/post/intra-cluster-correlations-over-time/), [using Bayesian models for estimation](https://www.rdatagen.net/post/bayes-model-to-estimate-stepped-wedge-trial-with-non-trivial-icc-structure/ ), [open cohorts](https://www.rdatagen.net/post/simulating-an-open-cohort-stepped-wedge-trial/), and [baseline measurements to improve efficiency](https://www.rdatagen.net/post/2021-12-07-exploring-design-effects-of-stepped-wedge-designs-with-baseline-measurements/)), and I won't give too much background.

In a typical stepped-wedge design (if there is such a thing), groups of sites (considered waves) is randomized to intervention starting times. For example, if there are 24 sites divided into 6 waves (so 4 sites per wave), there will be six starting times and 7 measurement periods (if we want to have at least one baseline/control period for each wave, and at least one intervention period per wave). Schematically, the design looks like this:
  
  ![](images/6_waves.png){width=75%}

We could use a linear mixed effects model to estimate the intervention effect $\delta$, which might look like this:
  
$$
  Y_{ijk} = a_{j} + \beta_{k} + \delta A_{jk} + e_{ijk}
$$
  
where $Y_{ijk}$ is the (continuous) outcome of individual $i$ in cluster $j$ during time period $k$. $a_j$ is the random intercept for site $j$, and we assume that $a_j \sim N(0, \sigma^2_a)$. $A_{jk}$ is the intervention indicator for site $j$ during time period $k$. $\beta_k$ is a period-specific effect. And $e_{ijk}$ is the individual level effect.

In the study that is motivating all of this, the situation is different in a key way.The intervention can only be implemented at one site a time (so that the number of waves equals the number of sites), leading to this alternative schematic:
  
![](images/24_waves.png){width=75%}

The challenge under this scenario, is that $k$ (the number of periods) is starting to get quite large, requiring us to estimate a large number of period specific effects $\beta_k$. In addition, the periods are actually shorter, so we have less information available to estimate those period effects. An alternative approach, as you may have anticipated, is to smooth the secular trend, using a model that looks like this:
  
$$
Y_{ijk} = a_{j} + s(k) + \delta A_{jk} + e_{ijk}
$$
  
where $s(.)$ is a smooth function of time. And by using a smooth function, we can take this one step further and specify a site-specific smoothing function $s_j(.)$:
  
$$
Y_{ijk} = a_{j} + s_j(k) + \delta A_{jk} + e_{ijk}
$$
  
So, we will use either splines or generalized additive models to estimate the curve, which will allow us to control for the period effect. By smoothing the function, we are assuming that the measurements closer in time are more highly correlated that measurements further apart.

### Data generation process

Here is the data generation process that we will use to explore the different models:
  
$$
Y_{ijk} \sim N(\mu_{ijk}, \sigma^2 = 40) \\
\mu_{ijk} = a_{j} + b_{jk} + \delta A_{jk} \\ 
a_j \sim N(0, \sigma^2_a = 9) \\
b_{jk} \sim N(0, \Sigma_b) \\
\delta = 5\\
$$
  
In this data generation process, the time effect will *not* be explicitly smooth, but the underlying covariance structure used to generate the period effects will induce some level of smoothness. This is similar to what was described in the previous [post](https://www.rdatagen.net/post/2022-11-01-modeling-secular-trend-in-crt-using-gam/). As in that earlier example, $b_{jk}$ is a site-specific time period effect for each time period $k$; the vector of cluster-time effects $\mathbf{b_j} \sim N(0, \Sigma_b)$, where $\Sigma_b = DRD$ is a $25 \times 25$ covariance matrix based on a diagonal matrix $D$ and an auto-regressive correlation structure $R$:
  
$$
D = 4 * I_{25 \times 25}
$$

and 

$$ 
R =\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \rho & \rho^2 & \dots & \rho^{24} \\
\rho & 1 & \rho & \dots & \rho^{23} \\
\rho^2 & \rho & 1 & \dots & \rho^{22} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
\rho^{24} & \rho^{23} & \rho^{22} & \dots & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}, \ \ \rho = 0.7 
$$
  
Now we are ready to implement this data generating process using `simstudy`. First the R packages that we will need:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(simstudy)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(mgcv)
library(lme4)
library(splines)
```

The data definitions for $a_j$, $b_{jk}$, and $Y_{ijk}$ are established first:
  
```{r}
def <- defData(varname = "a", formula = 0, variance = 9)
def <- defData(def, varname = "mu_b", formula = 0, dist = "nonrandom")
def <- defData(def, varname = "s2_b", formula = 16, dist = "nonrandom")

defOut <- defDataAdd(varname = "y", formula = "a + b + 5 * A", variance = 40)
```

Now, we generate 24 sites, create 25 periods for each site, generate the period-specific effects ($b_{jk}$) for each site, and assign the treatment status based on the stepped-wedge design:
  
```{r}
set.seed(1234)

ds <- genData(24, def, id = "site")
ds <- addPeriods(ds, 25, "site", perName = "k")

ds <- addCorGen(dtOld = ds, idvar = "site", 
                rho = 0.8, corstr = "ar1",
                dist = "normal", param1 = "mu_b", param2 = "s2_b", cnames = "b")

ds <- trtStepWedge(ds, "site", nWaves = 24, lenWaves = 1, startPer = 1, 
                   grpName = "A", perName = "k")

ds$site <- as.factor(ds$site)

ds
```

And finally, we generate 30 individuals per site per period. The figure shows the outcomes for all the sites overtime:
  
```{r}
dd <- genCluster(ds, "timeID", numIndsVar = 30, level1ID = "id")
dd <- addColumns(defOut, dd)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = dd, aes(x = k, y = y)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(A, labels = c("Control", "Intervention"))), 
             size = 0.1) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#d07b7c", "#7ba7d0")) +
  facet_wrap(~site, ncol = 8) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
  xlim(c(0, 24)) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 2)))
```

### Model estimation

I am fitting three models to this simulated data set: (1) a mixed effects model with fixed time period effects, (2), a mixed effects model with a random cubic spline for the period effect for each site, and (3) a generalized additive model with a site-specific smooth function for time. For each estimated model, I'm plotting the predicted values over the actual data points.

Since there is only so much one can glean from a single data set, I've also conducted an experiment using 5000+ replicated data sets to see how each model really performs with respect to the estimation of the treatment effect. (Code for these replications can be found [here](https://github.com/kgoldfeld/RDataGenBlog/blob/master/content/post/2022-12-13-modeling-the-secular-trend-in-a-stepped-wedge-design/replications/reps_hpc.R){target="_blank"}). These replications provide information about some operating characteristics of the model approaches (estimated bias, root mean squared error (RMSE), average estimated standard error, and coverage rate, i.e. proportion of 95% confidence intervals that include the true value 5).

#### Mixed effects model with fixed time-period effects

Here's the first model. Note that I am not estimating an intercept so that each period effect is directly estimated. (I did try to estimate site-specific period random effects, but it proved too computationally intensive for my computer, which ground away for a half hour before I mercifully stopped it). The model does include a site-specific random intercept.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
fitlme_k <- lmer(y ~ A + factor(k) - 1 + (1|site), data = dd)
summary(fitlme_k)
```

The predicted values indicate that the model does not pick up the site-specific variation over time:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4}
ddpred <- dd[, .SD[1,] , keyby = .(site, k)][, .(site, k, A)]
ddpred$y <- predict(fitlme_k, ddpred)

ggplot(data = ddpred, aes(x = k, y = y)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = k, y = y), data = dd, size = .01, color = "grey75") +
  geom_line(aes(group = A, color = factor(A, labels = c("Control", "Intervention")))) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#d07b7c", "#7ba7d0")) +
  facet_wrap(~site, ncol = 8) +
  facet_wrap(~site, ncol = 8) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  ) 
```

We can see that the estimate from this single data of the treatment effect is 5.8 [95\% CI: 5.5, 6.2]. Based on the replications, however, the treatment effect estimate from this model is actually *unbiased*. However, RMSE = 0.97 (which is equivalent to the true variation or standard error of the estimated treatment effect since there is no bias), but the average estimated standard error was only 0.18, and the coverage of the 95\% CIs was only 29\%. This model doesn't seem all that promising.

#### Mixed effects model with site-specific natural cubic spline

With the second model, also a mixed effects model, I've included a random cubic spline (based on four knots) instead of the random intercept:

```{r}
dd[, normk := (k - min(k))/(max(k) - min(k))]
knots <- c(.2, .4, .6, .8)

fitlme_s <- lmer(y ~ A + ( ns(normk, knots = knots) - 1 | site ), data = dd)
summary(fitlme_s)
```

Now we can see that the model predictions reflect the site-specific time trends:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4}
ddpred <- dd[, .SD[1,] , keyby = .(site, k)][, .(site, k, normk, A)]
ddpred$y <- predict(fitlme_s, ddpred)

ggplot(data = ddpred, aes(x = k, y = y)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = k, y = y), data = dd, size = .01, color = "grey75") +
  geom_line(aes(group = A, color = factor(A, labels = c("Control", "Intervention")))) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#d07b7c", "#7ba7d0")) +
  facet_wrap(~site, ncol = 8) +
  facet_wrap(~site, ncol = 8) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  ) 
```

This model also provides an unbiased estimate (in the case of the first data set, the estimate was spot on 5.0 [4.4, 5.6].) The RMSE was lower than the first model (0.78) and the average estimate of the standard error was slightly higher (0.31). The coverage was also higher, but still only 56\%. There is room for improvement.

#### GAM with site-specific smoother

This last model is a GAM (using the `gam` function from the `mgcv` package). A key parameter in the smoothing function `s` is the *bs* argument for the type of basis spline. I've used the option "fs" that allows for "random factor smooth interactions," which is what we need here. In addition, the dimension of the basis (the argument *k*, not to be confused with the period *k*), was set by evaluating the selection criterion (GCV) as well investigating the RMSE and the average estimated standard errors. A value between 10 and 15 seems to be ideal, I've settled on $k = 12$.

```{r}
gamfit <- gam(y ~ A + s(k, site, bs = "fs", k = 12), data = dd)
summary(gamfit)
```

The predicted value plot highlights that this model has estimated site-specific secular functions that are a little more wriggly than the cubic splines. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4}
ddpred <- dd[, .SD[1,] , keyby = .(site, k)][, .(site, k, A)]
ddpred$y <- predict(gamfit, ddpred)

ggplot(data = ddpred, aes(x = k, y = y)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = k, y = y), data = dd, size = .01, color = "grey75") +
  geom_line(aes(group = A, color = factor(A, labels = c("Control", "Intervention")))) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#d07b7c", "#7ba7d0")) +
  facet_wrap(~site, ncol = 8) +
  facet_wrap(~site, ncol = 8) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  ) 
```

In spite of the less smooth curve, the GAM estimate is unbiased as well with a slightly lower RMSE (0.76) then the cubic spline model (0.78). Better yet, the estimated standard errors averaged 0.45, and the coverage is 76% (compared to 56\% from the cubic spline model). 

In general, at least in this simulation setting, the GAM seems to be an improvement over the random cubic spline model, but it still underestimates the measure of uncertainty. There is more work to be done; perhaps it will be possible to bootstrap robust standard errors. To be continued ...
