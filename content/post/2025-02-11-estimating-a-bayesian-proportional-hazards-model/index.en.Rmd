Motivation: modeling time-to-event outcomes in the context of a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge design, and it appeared that fitting mixed effect survival models with existing packages was quite difficult if you want to accomdate flexible time patterns.

Figured I would try to do the modeling using Stan, so I started with trying to implement a simple Proportional Odds model (without clusterin or time-related trends). 

This was a joint effort between Stan documentation, ChatGPT/DeepSeek, and me.

I am going to present three and 1/2 iteration of models so you can understand how I arrived to where I did.

I am hoping that the final model is flexible enough to handle the extensions I need for the data structure that motivated all of this.
