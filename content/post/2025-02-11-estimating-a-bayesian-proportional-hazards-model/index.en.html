<p>A recent conversation with a colleague about a large <a href="https://www.rdatagen.net/post/2022-12-13-modeling-the-secular-trend-in-a-stepped-wedge-design/" target="_blank">stepped-wedge design</a> (SW-CRT) cluster randomized trial piqued my interest, because the primary outcome is time-to-event. This is not something I’ve seen before. A quick dive into the literature suggested that time-to-event outcomes are uncommon in SW-CRTs-and that the best analytic approach is not obvious. I was intrigued by how to analyze the data to estimate a hazard ratio while accounting for clustering and potential secular trends that might influence the time to the event.</p>
<p>Of course, my first thought was: <em>How would I simulate data to explore different modeling approaches?</em> And then: <em>Could a Bayesian approach be useful here?</em></p>
<p>Generating data with clustering and a secular time trend turned out to be quite straightforward, which I’ll share that in a future post. Here, I’m focusing on the my first attempts to implement a Bayesian model that might eventually accommodate cluster-level random effects and flexible secular trends using splines, something I explored more generally in an earlier <a href="https://www.rdatagen.net/post/2024-10-08-can-chatgpt-help-construct-non-trivial-bayesian-models-with-cluster-specific-splines/" target="_blank">post</a>.</p>
<p>Below, I start by generating a simple set of time-to-event outcomes (without any clustering or time trends) and fit a traditional Cox proportional hazards model to serve as a comparison. I then fit a Bayesian proportional hazards model using <code>Stan</code>code drawn from the <a href="https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/survival.html#proportional-hazards-model" target="_blank">online guide</a>. That model works fine, but it has a key limitation that I try to address, first partially successfully, and then pretty successfully. This post walks through all these steps.</p>

<h3>Simulating an RCT with time-to-event outcomes</h3>
<p>Here are the <code>R</code> packages that are used in this post:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(simstudy)
library(data.table)
library(survival)
library(cmdstanr)</code></pre>
<p>And here are the data definitions for a two-arm randomized controlled trial that is stratified by a variable <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. Both the treatment <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and covariate <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> are associated with the time-to-event outcome, as specified in <code>defS</code>. On average, the treatment <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> speeds up the time-to-event, and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> slows things down. (In <code>simstudy</code> survival times are <a href="https://www.rdatagen.net/post/2022-02-08-simulating-survival-outcomes-setting-the-parameters-for-the-desired-distribution/" target="_blank">generated</a> using a Weibull data generation process.)</p>

<p>Fitting a traditional Cox proportional hazards model, we can see that the log hazard ratio for treatment <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is greater than 0, suggesting that on average the time-to-event is shorter for those in the treatment arm.

<h3>First Bayes model</h3>
<p>As I mentioned before, I turned to <code>Stan</code> <a href="https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/survival.html#proportional-hazards-model" target="_blank">documentation</a> for the code that follows. I won’t go into the detailed derivation of the partial likelihood here since that is covered very nicely in the document. However, it is useful to see the final likelihood that is then reflected in the code.</p>
<p>The likelihood is written as follows (and note that the <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>’s represent only the cases with observed times, while <span class="math inline">\(j&#39;\)</span> include censored cases):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
L(\boldsymbol{\beta})= \prod_{j=1}^{N^{obs}} \left( \frac{\exp(\mathbf{x}_j^\top \boldsymbol{\beta})}{\sum_{j&#39;=j}^{N} \exp(\mathbf{x}_{j&#39;}^\top \boldsymbol{\beta})}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(N^{obs}\)</span> is the number of observed times,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the total number of observations (including censored),</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_i\)</span> is the vector of covariates for the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th observation,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)</span> is the vector of coefficients,</li>
</ul>
<p>We want the log likelihood, which transforms the product to a sum of logs:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\log Pr[\text{obs. fails ordered } 1, \dots N^{obs}|\mathbf{x}, \boldsymbol{\beta}] &amp;= \sum_{j=1}^{N^{obs}} \log \left( \frac{\exp(\mathbf{x}_j^\top \boldsymbol{\beta})}{\sum_{j&#39;=j}^{N} \exp(\mathbf{x}_{j&#39;}^\top \boldsymbol{\beta})}\right) \\
\\
&amp;= \sum_{j=1}^{N^{obs}} \left(\mathbf{x}_j^\top \boldsymbol{\beta} - \log \sum_{j&#39;=j}^{N} \exp(\mathbf{x}_{j&#39;}^\top \boldsymbol{\beta})\right)
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>In <code>Stan</code>, the function <code>logSumExp</code> can be used to efficiently calculate</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\log \sum_{j&#39;=j}^{N} \exp(\mathbf{x}_{j&#39;}^\top \boldsymbol{\beta}).
\]</span></p>
<p>This partial likelihood is implemented below in <code>Stan</code>. One confusing aspect (at least to me) is the way censoring is handled. Essentially, all event times for censored cases are assumed to occur <em>after</em> the last observed time. That is, all censored cases are part of the risk set for observed events, something I had not seen before. This is a pretty big assumption and has implications for data where the actual censoring times occur before the last observed event time.</p>
<p>The code might be a little confusing, because the data are delivered to <code>Stan</code> in reverse order. It is done this way to make calculation of the log likelihood more efficient. If you are trying to follow along with the code to see how it lines up with the equations above, keep this in mind.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>stan_code &lt;-

  beta ~ normal(0, 4);
  
  real log_denom = log_sum_exp(log_theta_c);
  
  for (n in 1:N) {
    log_denom = log_sum_exp(log_denom, log_theta[n]);
    target += log_theta[n] - log_denom;   // log likelihood
  }
  
}

<p>I’m using <code>cmdstanr</code> to interface with <code>Stan</code>. First we compile the <code>Stan</code> code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>stan_model &lt;- cmdstan_model(write_stan_file(stan_code))</code></pre>
<p>And then we fit the model. Even with 1,000 observations, the model estimates in just a couple of seconds on my laptop.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fit &lt;- stan_model$sample(
  data = stan_data,

<pre><code>## Running MCMC with 4 parallel chains...

<p>Looking at the log hazard ratios, something seems awry. The Bayesian estimates are attenuated relative to the original Cox PH estimates, and this is not due to the prior distribution assumption. Rather, it is the result of assuming that all censored times are longer than the longest observed time-to-event. I’m not showing this here, but the attenuation does largely go away if there is no censoring.</p>

<p>Given this limitation, I decided to try to implement an algorithm that accommodates dynamic risk sets, effectively taking censored cases out of the analysis as soon as they are censored. This is what the <code>coxph</code> model estimated above does.</p>

<p>The <code>Stan</code> code below implements the log likelihood that follows from this. In contrast to the first version, the data is passed to <code>Stan</code> in ascending order. The one major complication is that I needed to create a search function in order to define the “risk” set. (Actually, I asked DeepSeek to do this for me.) The fundamental difference between this version and the first is the calculation of the denominator in the log likelihood.</p>

<p>Two things to note about this model. First, it appears that estimates are spot on! They mirror the estimates from the <code>coxph</code> model using the <code>survival</code> package. That is encouraging. Second, the implementation is very inefficient, taking more than a minute to run! This is less encouraging, and does not bode well for a more complex model that incorporates random effects and splines.</p>

<h3>Final Bayes model</h3>
<p>I asked ChatGPT this time to see if it could make my code more efficient. (I’ve been comparing ChatGPT and DeepSeek - both have been pretty impressive.) It recognized that my initial brute force approach was calculating each denominator anew for each observed evaluation. This is highly inefficient, on the order of <span class="math inline">\(O(N^2)\)</span> (Unprompted, ChatGPT provided me with this information). The algorithm is reconfigured so that the denominators are pre-calculated - starting with the last time point (censored or observed), similar to the first approach. It turns out this is much more efficient with <span class="math inline">\(O(N)\)</span>.</p>

<p>The model also works well, as the estimate is the same as the previous Bayesian model and the <code>coxph</code> model. More importantly, the computation time is reduced considerably, to about 3 seconds. My hope is that this final model is flexible enough to handle the extensions I need for the data structure that sparked this whole exploration.</p>
