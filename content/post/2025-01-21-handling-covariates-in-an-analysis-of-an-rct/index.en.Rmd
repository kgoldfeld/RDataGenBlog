I was recently discussing the analytic plan for an RCT with a clinical collaborator, and she asked me if it is appropriate to adjust for pre-specified covariates that have been collected at baseline. One of her more seasoned colleagues had suggested that it is in fact *not* appropriate to make any adjustments in the model. I conveyed to her that this point of view is a bit "old school," and that indeed it is not just *OK* to adjust for baseline covariates, but that it really should be standard practice. However, even if the notion of *not* adjusting seems to me to be out-dated, it doesn't mean it is not prevalent. This is not the first time a clinical colleage asked me that question.

After that conversation, I decided to re-read the 1994 [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.4780131703){target="_blank"} by Stephen Senn that initially convinced me that it might be a very good idea to adjust for baseline covariates in an RCT. In that paper, Senn suggests that rather than inspecting for covariate imbalances before taking action, “the practical statistician will do well to establish beforehand a limited list of covariates deemed useful and fit them regardless. Such a strategy will *usually lead to a gain in power*, has no adverse effect on unconditional size and controls conditional size with respect to the covariates identified.”

In a subsequent [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.1296){target="_blank"}, Pocock et. al. reiterate/extend Senn's views. Although "experience shows that for most clinical trials, analyses which adjust for baseline covariates are in close agreement with the simpler unadjusted treatment comparisons", they argue adjusting for covariates can be justified if it helps: (1) achieve the most appropriate p-value for treatment differences, (2) provide unbiased estimates, and (3) improve precision.

I believe the traditional concern with covariate adjustment is the worry that flexible modeling could lead to a "fishing" expedition for the the covariates that lead to the most favorable effect estimate. Given this whiff of possible impropriety, it does not seem unreasonable to ask researchers to pre-specify which variables are likely to be prognosticators of the outcome (independent of the intervention under study) and adjust only for those.

In an RCT, we are interested in estimating the *causal* effect of the intervention on the outcome. Drawing on the formal theory of causal inference, in order to get an unbiased estimate of the causal effect, we need to ensure that the two groups are balanced with respect to all prognostic factors (there are a million places to learn about causal inference - I've tried to write about it over the years, starting with this [post](https://www.rdatagen.net/post/potential-outcomes-confounding/){target="_blank"}). In a randomized trial, the groups will be more or less balanced, so we can generally expect to get an unbiased estimate of the causal effect withtout making any adjustments. However, there may be chance imbalances, particularly in a study with a smaller sample size. If that is the case, those imbalances need to be addressed.

While randomization ensures balance on average across baseline covariates in an RCT, some researchers argue against covariate adjustment in the primary analysis due to concerns that it may alter the estimand or complicate interpretability. Unadjusted analyses are often preferred for their transparency and direct reflection of the randomized comparison. However, baseline covariate adjustment can improve the precision of treatment effect estimates by reducing residual variance without introducing bias, particularly when pre-specified.

However, adjusting for baseline covariates can offer important benefits. When pre-specified, such adjustments can improve the precision of treatment effect estimates by reducing residual variance, without introducing bias. Covariate adjustment may also help account for chance imbalances that can occur despite randomization, particularly in smaller trials. Ultimately, whether to adjust for baseline covariates should be guided by the trial's predefined objectives, the need for precision, and the clarity of the estimand being targeted.

Beyond direct adjustment in the outcome model, balancing approaches such as inverse probability weighting (IPW) and overlapping weights (OW) can also address covariate imbalances while preserving the original estimand. These weighting techniques reweight the sample to create balanced pseudo-populations without directly altering the outcome model structure, offering an alternative to regression-based adjustments. Ultimately, the choice of whether and how to adjust for baseline covariates should align with the trial's predefined objectives and the estimand being targeted.
