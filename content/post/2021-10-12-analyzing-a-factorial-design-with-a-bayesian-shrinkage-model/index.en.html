<p>Factorial study designs present a number of analytic challenges, not least of which is how to best understand whether simultaneously applying multiple interventions is beneficial. <a href="https://www.rdatagen.net/post/2021-09-28-analyzing-a-factorial-trial-with-a-bayesian-model/" target="_blank">Last time</a> I presented a possible approach that focuses on estimating the variance of effect size estimates using a Bayesian model. The scenario I used there focused on a hypothetical study evaluating two interventions with four different levels each. This time around, I am considering a proposed study to reduce emergency department (ED) use for patients living with dementia that I am actually involved with. This study would have three different interventions, but only two levels for each (i.e., yes or no), for a total of 8 arms. In this case - the model I proposed previously does not seem like it would work well; the posterior distributions based on the variance-based model turn out to be bi-modal in shape, making it quite difficult to interpret the findings. So, I decided to turn the focus away from variance and emphasize the effect size estimates for each arm compared to control.</p>
<div id="model-specification" class="section level3">
<h3>Model specification</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, this is a case with three interventions (<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>), each of which has two levels; the full factorial design will have 8 arms:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
(1) \ a&amp;=0, \ b=0, \ c=0 \\ 
(2) \ a&amp;=1, \ b=0, \ c=0 \\
(3) \ a&amp;=0, \ b=1, \ c=0 \\
(4) \ a&amp;=0, \ b=0, \ c=1 \\
(5) \ a&amp;=1, \ b=1, \ c=0 \\
(6) \ a&amp;=1, \ b=0, \ c=1 \\
(7) \ a&amp;=0, \ b=1, \ c=1 \\
(8) \ a&amp;=1, \ b=1, \ c=1 \\
\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>Although the proposed study is a cluster randomized trial, where each participating site will be assigned to one of the eight arms, I am simplifying things here a bit by assuming each individual patient <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> will be randomized to each of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(a_i \in \{0,1\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b_i\in \{0,1\}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(c_i\in \{0,1\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here is a model for outcome <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span>, a binary measure <span class="math inline">\((y_i \in {0,1})\)</span>, where the log-odds of the outcome for each patient is a function of the random assignment:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
y_{i} \sim \text{binomial}\left(p_{i}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{log}\left( \frac{p_{i}}{1-p_{i}}\right) =  \tau_0 + \tau_a a_i + \tau_b b_i + \tau_c c_i + \tau_{ab} a_i b_i +  \tau_{ac} a_i c_i + \tau_{bc} b_i c_i + \tau_{abc}a_i b_i c_i
\]</span></p>
<p>This is just a standard logistic model specification, where the parameters can be interpreted as log-odds ratios. For example, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_b = \tau_b\)</span> is the log odds ratio comparing patients randomized to receive only <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> (group 3 from above) with the control arm where patients receive none of the interventions (group 1), and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{ac} = \tau_a + \tau_c + \tau_{ac}\)</span> is the log odds ratio comparing patients randomized to only <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> but not <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> (group 6) compared with the control patients (group 1). This is the full set of log odds ratios for this design:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \lambda_a &amp;= \tau_a \\
  \lambda_b &amp;= \tau_b \\
  \lambda_c &amp;= \tau_c \\
  \lambda_{ab}  &amp;= \tau_a + \tau_b + \tau_{ab} \\
  \lambda_{ac}  &amp;= \tau_a + \tau_c + \tau_{ac} \\
  \lambda_{bc}  &amp;= \tau_b + \tau_c + \tau_{bc} \\
  \lambda_{abc} &amp;= \tau_a + \tau_b + \tau_c + \tau_{ab} + \tau_{ac} + \tau_{bc} + \tau_{abc} \\
\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>The focus of the analysis is to estimate posterior probability distributions for the <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\text{&#39;s}\)</span>, and possibly to compare across the <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\text{&#39;s}\)</span> (also using posterior distributions) to assess whether combining multiple interventions seems beneficial.</p>
</div>
<div id="prior-distribution-assumptions" class="section level3">
<h3>Prior distribution assumptions</h3>
<p>Rere are the prior distribution assumptions for the parameters in the Bayesian model:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \tau_0 &amp;\sim N(\mu=0, \sigma = 1) \\
  \tau_a, \tau_b, \tau_c &amp;\sim N(\mu = \delta_m, \sigma = \sigma_m) \\
  \tau_{ab}, \tau_{ac}, \tau_{bc} &amp;\sim N(\mu = \delta_x, \sigma = \sigma_x) \\
  \tau_{abc} &amp;\sim N(\mu = 0, \sigma = 1) \\
  \delta_m  &amp;\sim N(\mu = 0, \sigma = 1) \\
  \sigma_m &amp;\sim t_\text{student}(\text{df}=3, \mu=0, \sigma = 2.5), \ \sigma_m \ge 0 \\
  \delta_x  &amp;\sim N(0, 1) \\
  \sigma_x &amp;\sim t_\text{student}(\text{df}=3, \mu = 0, \sigma = 2.5), \ \sigma_x \ge 0 \\
\end{aligned}\]</span>
<p>While the focus of this model estimation is different from the approach I discussed <a href="https://www.rdatagen.net/post/2021-09-28-analyzing-a-factorial-trial-with-a-bayesian-model/" target="_blank">last time</a>, the prior distributions here share a key element with the earlier model. The priors for the main effects <span class="math inline">\(\tau_a, \ \tau_b, \text{ and } \tau_c\)</span> share a common mean <span class="math inline">\(\delta_m\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_m\)</span>. Likewise the prior distributions for the pair-wise interaction effects share a common mean <span class="math inline">\(\delta_x\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_x\)</span>. These four <em>hyperparameters</em> are estimated from the data. The prior distributions for the mean intervention effects <span class="math inline">\(\delta_m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\delta_x\)</span> are specified with the aim towards conservativism or skepticism, with a large portion of the distribution centered around 0. The priors for the variance parameters are more diffuse (using a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution with 3-degrees of freedom, a compromise between a <em>Cauchy</em> distribution with very broad tails and a <em>normal</em> distribution with more constrained tails).</p>
<p>Statistical inference will be based on an examination of the posterior distributions for the log odds ratios comparing each of the treatment combinations with the control arm where none of the interventions is implemented. We can also compare across different combinations to assess if one particular combination seems to be stronger than another. Since we are not using a null-hypothesis testing framework and the effect estimates are pooled across the interventions, adjustments for multiple testing are not necessary. (In the future, I can show results of the experiments where I explored the operating characteristics of these models. Because of the pooling and shrinkage that is built into the model, there are no inflated type 1 errors, analogous to the situation where I <a href="https://www.rdatagen.net/post/2021-09-14-drawing-the-wrong-conclusion-a-comparison-of-bayes-and-frequentist-methods/" target="_blank">evaluated</a> Bayesian methods for subgroup analysis.)</p>

<p>Here are the observed proportions by treatment arm. The fact that the two panels (<span class="math inline">\(c = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c = 1\)</span>) are pretty similar are an indication that intervention <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> has no impact. And the fact that lines are not parallel in each panel are an indication that there is some interaction (in this case negative).</p>

<p>Here is the code for the first plot, which shows the distribution of effect sizes (on the log-odds scale) for each of the intervention arms. I’ve extracted the samples using the <code>posterior</code> package function <code>as_draw_rvars</code> that I recently described <a href="https://www.rdatagen.net/post/2021-08-10-fitting-your-model-is-only-the-begining-bayesian-posterior-probability-checks/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at the figure, it is apparent that that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> likely had an effect, while <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> probably did not.

<p>Ultimately, how we present the data and draw our conclusions will depend on what we specify up front regarding the parameters and comparisons of interest. The great thing about a Bayesian model is that we have estimated everything in a single model, so there are no real concerns with multiple comparisons. However, reviewers still like to see results for analyses that were pre-specified. And if a decision is to be made based on those results, those decision rules should be pre-specified. But, my preference would be to show the findings and let readers decide if the results are compelling and/or determine if a more focused trial is needed.</p>
<p>In the next (and most likely, for now at least, final) post on this topic, I plan on describing how I approached sample size estimation for this proposed study.</p>
