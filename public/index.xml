      <description>Say we have an intervention that is assigned at a group or cluster level but the outcome is measured at an individual level (e.g. students in different schools, eyes on different individuals). And, say this outcome is binary; that is, something happens, or it doesn’t. (This is important, because none of this is true if the outcome is continuous and at close to normally distributed.) If we want to measure the effect of the intervention - perhaps the risk difference, risk ratio, or odds ratio - it can really matter if we are interested in the marginal effect or the conditional effect, because there is a good chance they won’t be the same.</description>

      <description>I learned statistics and probability by simulating data. Sure, I did the occasional proof, but I never believed the results until I saw it in a simulation. I guess I have it backwards, but I that’s just the way I am. And now that I am a so-called professional, I continue to use simulation to understand models, to do sample size estimates and power calculations, and of course to teach.</description>

      <title>Everyone knows that loops in R are to be avoided, but vectorization is not always possible</title>

      <description>It goes without saying that there are always many ways to solve a problem in R, but clearly some ways are better (for example, faster) than others. Recently, I found myself in a situation where I could not find a way to avoid using a loop, and I was immediately concerned, knowding that I would want this code to be flexible enough to run with a very large number of observations, possibly over many observations.</description>
