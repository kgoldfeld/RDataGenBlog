<p>A researcher was presenting his interesting research that was trying to understand what impact childhood trauma might have on subsequent substance abuse in adulthood. Obviously, a very challenging research question, with many possible causal pathways and certainly unmeasured confounding. However, as he was describing the statistical model, it was clear he may have been overzealous in controlling for a measurement he did have - poverty in adulthood - believing it was somehow confounding the relationship of trauma and substance use. A confounder is a common cause of an exposure/treatment and an outcome; it is hard to conceive of adult poverty as a cause of childhood events, even thoughit might be related to adult substance use (or maybe not). At best, controlling for adult poverty has no impact on the conclusions of the research; less good, though, is the possibility that it will lead to the conclusion that the effect of trauma is less than it actually is.</p>
<p>Using a highly contrived simulation of data and the abstract concept of , I wanted to see if I could illuminate some of the issues.</p>
